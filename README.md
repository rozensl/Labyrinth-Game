This project repository contains a program that renders a 3D labyrinth that can be tilted on a fixed axis. There is a ball on the board, which needs to be navigated throughout the maze in order to complete the challenge.

There is a timer that starts as soon as the board is tilted. The goal is to beat the highscore (lowest time taken). The timer stops when the ball has escaped the maze.

# Post Prototype Updates:
## Texture
> Textures are located in the assets directory.  
> [PPM Loader](utils/PPM.h) is used to load the textures.
- Texture has been added to the floor and walls.
- Football texture is loaded via the [football.mtl](assets/football.mtl) file via the [Obj Loader](utils/objectLoader.h) as implemented in Prototype.
- Walls, Floor and HUD textures are loaded via PPM Loader.

## Base Board
> Located in [board.h](board.h)
- Base board has been updated as a singular cube entity instead of multiple cubes. This was done to support edge to edge textures instead of repeating textures.
- Dynamic sizing has also been implemented. Boards of any size (should have the same height and width) can be created and used dynamically without any changes in the code.
   
## Autotilt
> Located as [autoTilt()](main.cpp)  in main.cpp
- Slowly brings base/floor back to the original position to stop the ball from constant movement.
- This also increases the level of challenge for the game.
   
## Automated Maze Generation
> Located in [mazeGen.h](utils/mazeGen.h)
- Automated random maze/labyrinth generation.
- This is done by using a recursive backtracking depth first search algorithm.
- Code from [StackOverflow](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/135443) has been borrowed with minor modifications.
- Generated Maze can be played with by pressing the '4' key.
  
## File Manager
> Located in [fileManager.h](utils/fileManager.h)
- A file manager has been implemented that saves and loads the highscores for each level.
- This enables the program to be played multiple times with saved scores even after restarting.
- This file manager is also responsible for loading/saving the board/game data from "board.txt" placed in root directory along with main.cpp and pressing key '5'.
- Use https://3gc3.anantj.repl.co/ to visualize and generate the board.txt file.
  
## High Score
> Located in [animate() method](main.cpp) in main.cpp
- Using the file manager, a high score (lowest time taken to complete the game) is saved and loaded for each level.
- This is done automatically in the background without any need for user interaction.
- This data is saved in a file called "save.txt" placed in root directory.
  
## Debug Mode
- Pressing '0' will enable debug mode which will print useful information on the screen, such as ball's position, board tilt, ball's allowed movement, camera's position, etc.

## Lighting
> Located in [main.cpp](main.cpp)
- Lighting and shadows have been implemented.
  
## Updated Collision Detection
> Located in [updateBallPosition() method](main.cpp) in main.cpp
- A new collision detected algorithm has been implemented.
- This algorithm is more accurate and more efficient than the previous one used for the prototype.
- In this routine, we verify the directions the ball is able to move in based on the current position of the ball and the immidiate walls next to it.
- This also fixes the bug where the ball would clip through walls if the tilt was greater than 15 degrees.
  
## Web Application for Board Management 
> Located in [website](website/index.html)
- A web application has been implemented that enables user to visualize, generate, upload and download custome boards.
- This application is accessible at : https://3gc3.anantj.repl.co/
## HUD
> Located in [HUD.h](HUD.h)
- A base Heads Up Display has been added to the application.
- This display shows the basic controls, as well as the target score and current score
  
## Winning Condition
- Player wins when the ball escapes the maze.
  
## Board Tilt Based on Camera Movement
- The board now tilts based on camera's position.
- This means that pressing 'A' will always tilt the board left relative to the user's position and so on.
- This was done by casting a ray from the camera to the board origin, then computin tilt values based on this ray's normals.

# What's Included (Pre Prototype)
## Base Board with Tilt
> Located in [Board Class](board.h)

The board is drawn in [main.cpp](main.cpp) based on **baseSize** defined at the beginning of the program.

The board is redrawn on every animation cycle, with it's rotation/incline managed by **xIncr**, **yIncr** & **zIncr**.

The board can be tilted by using the **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** keys.

## .OBJ Loader
A .obj object loader has been implemented with the help of the [OBJ-Loader](https://github.com/Bly7/OBJ-Loader) library.

This library was chosen because:
- It is a single header file that can be reused in multiple locations throughout the project without additional imports.
- It is compatible with our requirements as it uses standard methods and data structures, without introducing additional dependencies (such as GLEW which other .obj loaders might include)
- It is available to use under the **MIT License** which allows us to use and modify this software as long as due credit is provided to the creators.
-  Support for **.mtl** files which can introduce material properties (lighting, colors, etc) while importing the object.
- It is extremely easy to use, with all the raw data available as needed, and this data is used by the **Mesh Renderer** to render the object. 

## Mesh Renderer
> Located in [main.cpp as drawFromObj()](main.cpp)

This rendered uses data obtained from the .obj loader, and uses it to render the object on the display.
For each mesh, multiple triangles are drawn, each with their own texture coordinates, normal and material properties.

The implementation of this renderer has been inspired from: 
 - [.obj loader's examples](https://github.com/Bly7/OBJ-Loader/blob/master/examples/1%20-%20LoadAndPrint/e1_loadandprint.cpp) for instruction about obtaining the data.
 - [# Lecture 6-objects and meshes](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/le/content/414625/viewContent/3401120/View) for guidance on rendering
 
 ## Camera controls
 > Located in [Camera class](camera.h)

A camera system has been implemented that revolves around the board with variable zoom.

The position is calculated by using the following formula:
 - x = radius \* sin(angle)
 - z = radius \* cos(angle)

Using this, we can place the camera at a distance of **radius** from the origin at angle **angle** and get the x and z co-ordinates.

Movement :
- The **angle/position** can be changed using **left** and **right** arrow keys.
- The **radius/zoom** can be changed using **U** and **J** keys.
- Camera's height can be changed using **up** and **down** arrow keys.
- Camera's rotation is fixed as {0,1,0} (upright on y axis).
- Camera is always focus on/looking at the origin {0,0,0}.

## Ball
> Located in [Ball class](shapes/ball.h)

This is the ball that is placed on the board, and it moves and rotates as the board is tilted. This class contains information about the position, rotation and speed of the ball, while the material, color and other visual properties are loaded in via the .obj loader.

## Walls/Maze
> Located in [main.cpp](main.cpp)

- The walls are represented as a 2D Matrix. 
- The size of the walls needs to be the same as the size of the base board (**baseSize**), otherwise it might exceed the boundaries of the board.
- This wall is re-rendered on every animation cycle, on top of the base matrix which contains the board. This has been implemented this way because the walls also need to rotate as the base board rotates, otherwise clipping will occur.
- The wall/maze is rendered via the **renderWalls()** method. For each **1** present in the **Wall** matrix, a solid cube of size 1 is rendered at it's location.

## Collision Detection
> Located in [main.cpp](main.cpp)

A basic collision detection algorithm has been implemented. This algorithm is run on every animation cycle.
The way this works is:
- On every animation cycle, we detect where the ball will be next, based on the current tilt of the board.
- If the ball (or its boundaries) appears to be in the same position as where a wall exists, we stop the ball from moving into that location.
- We do this again, but with tilt on only one axis, to determine if the movement towards another axis allows the ball to move without collision.
- If collision is not detected on both axis, we allow the ball to move freely towards the direction of the tilt.
- If collision is only detected on one axis, we allow the ball to move towards the other axis.
- If collision is detected on both axis, we do not allow the ball to move.

Since we are only computing the expected position of the ball and then checking if a wall exists at that location, this is a constant time operation and it's time complexity is O(1).  

# Identified Bugs
- [x] ~~The ball clips through the walls if the tilt is too much, eventually breaking the game and requiring a restart.~~
